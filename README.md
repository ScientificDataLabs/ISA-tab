# ScientificData
This repository contains resources designed to support projects developing tools to manipulate, mine and display structured ISA-tab records published at *Scientific Data* (http://www.nature.com/sdata/).

All ISA-tab records hosted in this repository should be considered experimental versions. They may vary from the official versions hosted on the *Scientific Data* journal website.

*Scientific Data* is an open-access, peer-reviewed publication for descriptions of scientifically valuable datasets. Our primary article-type, the Data Descriptor, is designed to make published data more discoverable, interpretable and reusable. To this end, each article includes a structured, machine-readable metadata record describing key features of the experimental samples and the techniques used to generate the data (for example, organism, tissue source, technologies). Metadata is captured and distributed using the ‘Investigation’, ‘Study’ and ‘Assay’ format (ISA-Tab).  

For more on the ISA-tab format, visit the ISA Commons (http://isacommons.sourceforge.net/) and ISA Tools (http://www.isa-tools.org/) websites.
